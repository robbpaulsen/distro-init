		if it is a string like 'some/directory' then `-o some/directory` will be added to `stylus` compiler.
		if it is false or not string then it will compile your `style.stylus` to the directory it is in.

			compileDir": "out"
		Directory is absolute if specified such as
			compileDir": "/home/logan/Desktop/out"
