New features
    1) Support for keywords using embedded arguments

       This release brings support for keyword using
       embedded arguments syntax. In the previous releases
       it was not possible to see keyword documentation or
       jump to keyword if the keyword was using embedded
       arguments syntax. Also the previous release the
       embedded arguments syntax was not completed correctly
       by the plugin. In this release the plugin is able show
       keyword documentation and jump to keyword also from
       keyword using embedded arguments syntax. Also the
       plugin supports keyword embedded arguments syntax
       coming from libraries and keyword tables in resource
       or test data files.

Bug fixes
    1) Snippets using `:f` did not work
       There always have been snippets to provide templates
       for different kind of for loops. It in some previous
       release the keyword completion feature did start to
       overwrite the snippets using `:f`. In this release,
       the `:f` snippets works normally again.

Backwards incompatible changes
    This release should not contain changes which would
    be backwards incompatible.
