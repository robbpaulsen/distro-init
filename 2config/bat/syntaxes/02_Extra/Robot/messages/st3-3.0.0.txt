This is a total rewrite of the Robot Framework Assistant plugin.

The highlights of the rewrite are:
1) Less configuration.
In the 1.X.X version of Robot Framework Assistant plugin, there
is scanner configuration which can be which can be complex to maintain.
From the version 3.0.0  onwards, there is only one setting,
robot_framework_workspace, where the test data is searched.

2) Provide keyword completion based the imported resources and libraries.
In the 1.X.X version Robot Framework Assistant plugin the keyword
competition will provide all found keywords and it doesn't take in
account is the resource or/and library imported. The version 3.0.0 takes
the imports in account and will provide keyword competition based
on the imports. The only exception to this rule is if library
is parsed from the libdoc XML format. The libraries parser
from the XML format are globally available.

3) Better variable completions
The 1.X.X version provides only the built in variables completions.
The version 3.0.0 also provides the built in variables, variables
from variable tables and variable files. Also variable completion is
based on the imports.

4) Better library parsing
The version 3.0.0 keyword and variable parsing relies on the
Robot Framework API (public and not public). Plugin is able to parse
the keywords also from the dynamic and hybrid libraries. If your
libraries can produce keyword documentation with libdoc, there is
a good change that plugin is able to parse the library based on
the imports in the test data too. There is one limitation on the
matter. The limitation is that if library import contains arguments
as Robot Framework variables, plugin can not resolve those variables.
Depending the library implementation this may prevent resolving
the keywords from the library.
