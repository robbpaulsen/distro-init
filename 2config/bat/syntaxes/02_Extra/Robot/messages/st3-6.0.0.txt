New features
    1) Keyword completion provides also completion to WITH NAME syntax

Bug fixes:
    1) Add missing [Setup] snippet
    2) Keywords arguments with two default values are not completed correctly

    If keyword contained two or more arguments which did have a variables
    as a default value, then the keyword argument variables where not
    completed correctly.

    3) Libraries imported WITH NAME syntax where not working correctly

    When library was imported WITH NAME syntax, then the keyword completion
    did not provide completions correctly.

    4) On Mac OS plugin mouse map did break the shift click.

    This is backwards incompatible change.
