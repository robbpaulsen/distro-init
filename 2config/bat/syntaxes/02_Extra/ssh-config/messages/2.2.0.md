v2.2.0 (2019-03-29)
===================

If you were missing autocomplete as you type, add a syntax-specific setting with this content (or add this key):

``` json
{
    "auto_complete_selector": "text.ssh_config, text.sshd_config"
}
```

## SSH Config

- Meta scopes for blocks (`Host` and `Match`), conditionals, and options
- Support for `=` in option assignment
- Mild support for double-quoted option values
- Boolean-only options now complain about non-boolean values
- Highlight wildcards and commas in generic values
