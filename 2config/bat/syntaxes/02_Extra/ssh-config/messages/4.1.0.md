v4.1.0 (2020-10-09)
===================

- The "Open SSH Config" command now sets highlighting, since `config` is not
    listed in the file extensions (owing to conflicts with e.g. `.git/config`)
- New crypto items.
- Fix MACs in SSHD Config.
- Slightly slimmer package size.
    + If this release breaks the package for you, file a bug. There's a small
        chance that could happen.
