v2.0.0 (2018-09-20)
===================

**Support is _dropped_ for Sublime Text 2.**
ST2 users can continue using the package as it existed in 2015.

- Separate SSH / SSHD file syntax and completions
- Additional highlighting
- Go-to-Symbol support (`Cmd`+`R` or `Ctrl`+`R`)
- Commands to open `~/.ssh/config` and `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
