v3.6.0 (2020-05-12)
===================

It's been a little while since the last update message. New since 3.0.0:

- Varying levels of support for `known_hosts`, `authorized_keys`, and
  public/private key files

- More completions, including
    + `Match` block snippets
    + Suggested values for many SSH options
    + (More improvements forthcoming)

- Configurable file locations in case your config files are stored in
  novel places

- Pedantic IPv4/IPv6 validation.
    + Helps avoid not-really-IPs like `189.23.290.13`
    + These are also added to https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Hosts for
      `/etc/hosts` with examples of matching and non-matching IP-like strings.

- Highlighting of some crypto builtins

- Local symbol list for SSHD Config now also matches commented-out items,
  since it seems to be standard practice to toggle them.  You don't need
  to make a _new_ `MaxAuthTries` somewhere else in the file when there's
  already a commented-out one in there.

- Minor performance improvements
