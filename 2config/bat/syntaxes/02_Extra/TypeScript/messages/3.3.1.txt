Welcome to the TypeScript plugin for Sublime Text!

Details about this package and its feature can be found on its GitHub
repository at https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Sublime-Plugin.

This release ships with TypeScript 3.3.1, and also supports editing in
JavaScript files thanks to work done by GitHub users @zhengbli and @idiotWu.

With this mode, users will receive TypeScript-powered features like
more accurate completions, renaming capabilities, refactoring, go-to-definition,
and find-all-references. Users can also get error checking in JavaScript files in
the presence of `checkJs` in a `tsconfig.json` file, or a `// @ts-check` comment
at the top of your file. This functionality can be disabled by explicitly setting
the `enable_language_service_for_javascript` setting in your preferences to `false`.

This release also sets error regions to `invalid.illegal` so that themes can leverage
them appropriately - courtesy of work done by @rgant.

Finally, this release includes a fix for renaming issues when renamed entities occur on the same line.
