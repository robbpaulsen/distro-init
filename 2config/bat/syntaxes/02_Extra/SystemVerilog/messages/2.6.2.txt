SystemVerilog 2.6.2 Changelog:

## Improvement ##
 - Show signal information now works on multiple level of hierarchy (class.member.field for example)

## Fix ##
 - Update a regexp used to parse file to avoid some deadlock (could happen in large file with lot's of comment/empty line)
 - Add limit to the popup text to avoid crashing sublime text (happens with complex interface/module with huge number of port/signal)
