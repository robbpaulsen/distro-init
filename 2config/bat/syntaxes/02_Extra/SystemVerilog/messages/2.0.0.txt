SystemVerilog 2.0.0 Changelog:

## Improvement ##
 - Alignement:
  * Most alignement function move to a standalone python module to allow reuse outside of SublimeText
  * complete rewriting of basic parser => should now handle a lot more indentation cases
 - Start using new sublime syntax format (need version 3084):
  * now highlight trailing unmatched ) or ] as error
  * Update the typedef highlight using new mechanism => allow better highlighting, especially when there is some line return in the middle of the definition (or comments)
 - Find instance is now asynchonous and allows to navogate to the file using double click (just like Find in files)

## Bug Fix ##
 - Parsing of port module with arithemetic operation (fix from mgolokhov)
 - Highlight of typedef of array with arithemetic operation (fix from kelvin_green)
