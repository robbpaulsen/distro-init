SystemVerilog 2.16.0 Changelog:


## Enhancement ###
 - Hierarchy:
    * Add option to open the hierarchy in a new window (sv.hierarchy_new_window)
    * Add function to navigate from the hierarchy to the instance or module name properly.
    * Add marker [U] for unresolved reference

## Keybind Update ##
To use the new function to navigate in the hierarchy add the following keybind:

```
	{
		"keys": ["f12"], "command": "verilog_hierarchy_goto_definition",
		"context":
		[
			{ "key": "selector", "operator": "equal", "operand": "text.result-systemverilog"}
		]
	}
```

It is also possible to bind some mouse click, but be aware that sublime does not support
context sensitive binding, meaning that you will override whatever was bind to the mouse click !
Here is an example to bind 'ctrl+right click' to the command:

```
	{
        "button": "button2", "modifiers": ["ctrl"],
        "command": "verilog_hierarchy_goto_definition",
        "press_command": "drag_select",
    }
```
