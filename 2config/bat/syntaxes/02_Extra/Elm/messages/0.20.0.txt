New in Elm Language Support 0.20.0 (June 10, 2017)

- New: elm-format errors display in a pop-up panel at the bottom of the Sublime
  Text window, which disappears again once you correct the issue and re-run
  elm-format. (Thanks, @stoivo!)

- Improvement: README.md lists snippets supported by this package. (Thanks,
  @Bernardoow!)
