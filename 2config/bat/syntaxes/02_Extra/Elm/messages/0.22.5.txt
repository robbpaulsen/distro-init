New in Elm Language Support 0.22.5 (August 25, 2018)

Nothing, except fixing a typo in this VERY IMPORTANT message:

  Elm 0.19 was recently released:
  https://elm-lang.org/blog/small-assets-without-the-headache

  It makes major, breaking changes to the compiler's interface with packages
  like this one. It is likely the next release of Elm Language Support will
  break compatibility with Elm 0.18.

  If you plan to remain on Elm 0.18 for now, you should configure Package
  Control to ignore updates to this package until you are ready to upgrade.
  In Sublime Text, choose Preferences > Package Settings > Package Control >
  Settings – User, then add this setting to your
  Package Control.sublime-settings file:

  {
    "auto_upgrade_ignore": [
      "Elm Language Support"
    ],
  }


  Upgrading to Elm 0.19

  A pre-release version of this package with experimental support for Elm 0.19
  is available. If you're using Elm 0.19 already, we'd value your feedback!

  WARNING: This new version does not support Elm 0.18!

  To upgrade, configure Package Control to install pre-release versions of this
  package. In Sublime Text, choose Preferences > Package Settings > Package
  Control > Settings – User, then add this setting to your
  Package Control.sublime-settings file:

  {
    "install_prereleases":
    [
      "Elm Language Support"
    ],
  }

  Then use the Package Control: Upgrade Package command in the Command
  Palette to upgrade. Make sure to read the release notes that are displayed
  following the upgrade!
