New in Elm Language Support 0.21.0 (Nov 5, 2017)

- Improvement: Elm language syntax files are now implemented using
  Sublime Text's new .sublime-syntax format, and supports Goto Symbol properly
  (listing each function only once, instead of including the type annotations).
  (Thanks, @stoivo!)

- New: ‘debug’ snippet that makes using `Debug.log` to output values to the
  console very convenient. (Thanks, @Bernardoow!)
